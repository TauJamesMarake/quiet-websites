# You Are Not Late

A website that exists to remove urgency.

## Concept
This project addresses the quiet pressure of time -
the feeling of being behind, late, or overdue.

Instead of pushing forward,
it pauses.

There is nothing to catch up on.
No action required.

## Features
- Live local time display
- Slowly changing reassuring messages
- Light / Dark mode toggle
- Subtle film-grain texture
- Fully responsive design

- No tracking, analytics, or cookies

## Privacy
This site collects nothing.
Time is displayed locally and disappears when you leave.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

No frameworks.
No libraries.
No urgency.

## Why This Exists
Modern life is structured around deadlines.
This page offers a moment outside of them.
