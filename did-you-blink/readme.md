# Did You Blink?

A quiet website that measures nothing important —  
except the moment you just lost.

## Concept
“Did You Blink?” is a minimal, single-purpose website designed to remind the visitor how effortlessly time passes.

There are no goals, no achievements, and no outcomes.
Just seconds counting upward — and moments quietly disappearing.

The experience is meant to be gentle, slightly playful, and lightly philosophical.
Nothing dramatic happens.
That’s the point.

## Features
- Live seconds counter
- Periodic reflective messages
- Light / Dark mode toggle
- Subtle breathing ambient sound (optional)
- Soft film-grain background texture
- Native share button
- Analytics-free visit counter (local device only)
- Fully responsive, single-page experience

## Sound Design
The breathing sound is optional and user-controlled.
It exists to slow the experience down, not to distract from it.

Silence is also a valid choice.

## Privacy
This website uses:

- No cookies
- No third-party analytics
- No tracking

The visit counter is stored locally on the user’s device using `localStorage`.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

No frameworks.
No libraries.
No build process.

## Why This Exists
Most websites compete for attention.
This one simply acknowledges its passage.

Time moves whether we notice it or not.

This page just makes it visible.
