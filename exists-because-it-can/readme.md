# This Website Exists Because It Can

No ads.  
No tracking.  
No calls to action.  

Just a website... existing.

## Concept
This project explores intentional emptiness.
It asks what happens when a website does nothing,
and whether curiosity alone is enough to keep someone engaged.

There is no goal.
There is no reward.
Only time passing.

## Features

- Minimal, responsive design
- Light / Dark mode toggle
- Subtle film-grain texture
- Evolving button interaction
- Existential time counter
- No analytics, cookies, or tracking
- Zero dependencies

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Why This Exists
Because not everything needs to optimize engagement.
Sometimes restraint says more than features.
